# Earquake Visiualization

### Background
- The United States Grological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientisits develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. I will be helping them them out with an exciting new project! 
- The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will alow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing out planet.

### Creating the Main Map
- Create a main map with a street and topographic layer
- Then add functionality to control the map and to start the display overlooking the United States.

### Creating the Earthquake Layer
- Add a style layer for the earthquake
- Separate earthquakes by magnitude and designate a color for each class
- Have bubbles display the earthquake and represent the magnitude by size

### Add Tetonic Plates
- Insert the data to display tetonic plates on the map and a legend.
